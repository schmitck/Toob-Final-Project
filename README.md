# Toob-Final-Project
This app is called Toob - it is a surfing app that is focused on providing daily updates on surf spots in your area.
Now, this idea has already been done by great apps like Surfline and Magic Seaweed, but they were missing a key part of updating people the waves - they never really show the waves.
There are surf cams that are set up, but that requires "premium" subscription payments, so I created Toob to combat it.
This app is a place where people at surf spots can post their photos about the spots and become the "updaters." 
All people need to do is go to their favorite spots, find it on my app, and post a photo with a quick description and rating.
Now people who are checking spots only need to click on their favorite spots and - boom! - they get to see in-time updates of the waves.
Surfers can now make quick and easy decisions about what are the best spots to surf, and do not need to waste any time in the water trying to choose a spot.
Thank you!
